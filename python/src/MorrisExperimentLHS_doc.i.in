"MorrisExperimentLHS builds experiments for the Morris method using a centered LHS design as input starting.

Available constructors:

    MorrisExperimentLHS(lhsDesign, N)

    MorrisExperimentLHS(lhsDesign, interval, N)

Parameters
----------
lhsDesign : :py:class:`openturns.Sample`
    Initial design
interval : :py:class:`openturns.Interval`
    Bounds of the domain
N : int
    Number of trajectories

Notes
-----
With the first constructor, we fix the initial design which could be an LHS, an optimal LHS defined using uniform marginals.
With the second constructor LHS design and bounds are required.

The method consists in generating trajectories (paths) by randomly selecting their initial points from the lhs design.
If number of trajectories is lesser than the lhsDesign's size, we enforce the selection of the starting point using
:py:class:`openturns.KPermutationsDistribution` which ensure full different trajectories."
