"MorrisExperiment builds experiments for the Morris method.

Available constructors:
    MorrisExperiment(levels, N)
    MorrisExperiment(levels, N, interval)
    MorrisExperiment(lhsDesign, N)
    MorrisExperiment(lhsDesign, N, interval)

Parameters
----------
levels: :py:class:`openturns.Indices`
    Number of levels for a regular grid
N: int
    Number of trajectories
interval: :py:class:`openturns.Interval`
    Bounds of the domain
lhsDesign: :py:class:`openturns.NumericalSample`
    Initial design

Notes
-----
With first constructor, we consider that initial experiment is a regular grid defined in :math:`[0,1]^d`.
With second constructor, we consider that initial distribution model is uniform with bounds given by the interval argument. Also, the initial experiment is of type regular.
With third argument, we fix the initial design which could be an LHS, an optimal LHS defined in :math:`[0,1]^d`.
Finally the fourth constructor requires an LHS design and bounds.
